<b>The Web:</b><br>
 ~Made up of HTML<br>
 ~Images, Videos,Music, and Plain text are all files found on the web<br>
<p>You search for something on you browser and it asks the internet to find it. To find what you are searching for the internet asks the servers to look for the files you need. All of these requests are made using HTTP. HTTP is the main protocal of the Web.</p>
<br>
<b>HTML</b>:<br>
~It is the heart of the Web<br>
~Stands for <em>Hypertext Markup Language</em><br>
~Made of:<br>
Text content - what you see <br>
Mark up - what it looks like<br>
References to other doc. - Images or videos<br>
Links to other pages<br>
<br>
HTML Markup, HTML Attributes, White space, Inline/Block:<br>
~HTML is made up of <em>tags</em><br>
b = bold; em = italics; a = anchor (used for making links); a href = putting a website as a link; img = Image; img src = putting the image on page; src + href are attributes and there can be multiple ones making up a whole tag; br = breaks text; p = paragraph; div = divide the text.<br>
~ Inline just breaks the text from where you put the br; Block puts the tex that is inbetween the two div  into a block in which you can manipulate the height and width.
